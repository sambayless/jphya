This is a Java port of the [Phya](http://www.zenprobe.com/phya/) physics sound simulation library, which generates realistic sound representations of collisions in physics worlds in real time.

JPhya is an object oriented re-packaging of Phya; the majority of Phya's original features are fully supported. JPhya is already fully usable, but it is still in development and the API is still subject to changes.

You may use JPhya with any underlying sound library; bindings are provided for [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/). An interactive physics demo showing correct usage is provided using the [JME](http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/) 3D library.

Documentation and examples are fairly sparse; users are referred to the original Phya project for additional examples and information.
